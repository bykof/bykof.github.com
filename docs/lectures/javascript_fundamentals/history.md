# History

JavaScript was created in May 1995 in 10 days, by Brendan Eich.
Eich worked at Netscape and implemented JavaScript for their web browser, Netscape Navigator.
The idea was that major interactive parts of the client-side web were to be implemented in Java. JavaScript was supposed to be a glue language for those parts and to also make HTML slightly more interactive. Given its role of assisting Java, JavaScript had to look like Java. That ruled out existing solutions such as Perl, Python, TCL, and others.

Initially, JavaScript’s name changed several times:
* Its code name was Mocha.
* In the Netscape Navigator 2.0 betas (September 1995), it was called LiveScript.
* In Netscape Navigator 2.0 beta 3 (December 1995), it got its final name, JavaScript.

ECMAScript Standard (European Computer Manufacturers Association)
The language described by these standards is called ECMAScript, not JavaScript. A differ- ent name was chosen because Sun (now Oracle) had a trademark for the latter name. The “ECMA” in “ECMAScript” comes from the organization that hosts the primary standard.

* The term JavaScript refers to the language and its implementations.
* The term ECMAScript refers to the language standard and language versions.

Current ECMAScript Version: __11th Edition (ECMAScript 2020)__
