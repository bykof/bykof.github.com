# TC39 (Technical Committee 39)

TC39 is the committee that evolves JavaScript. Its members are, strictly speaking, compa- nies: Adobe, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, Opera, Twitter, and others. That is, companies that are usually fierce competitors are working together for the good of the language.

Every two months, TC39 has meetings that member-appointed delegates and invited experts attend. The minutes of those meetings are public in a GitHub repository.
