# Introduction

In the following lecture we will discuss React at it's core.

After the discussion, we will look at how to use React to build Web Applications.

Please consider, that starting at this point is not a good idea.

If you haven't done the lectures [JavaScript Fundamentals](./../javascript-fundamentals/index.md) and [Browser API](./../browser-api/index.md),
I would suggest you, that you go back and start from that point.

If you will proceed here, you will achieve maybe fast results, but in the long run it will get harder and harder
to build a web application without the underlying knowlegde of the basics.

So if you've already done the basics, let's right jump into it.
