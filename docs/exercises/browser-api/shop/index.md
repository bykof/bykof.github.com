# Shop Exercise

Let's continue with our shopping example in exercise [JavaScript Fundamentals - Shop](../../javascript-fundamentals/shop/index.md).

Now we build an interface for the shop.

It will look like this: responsive, mobile-ready, fast as hell ðŸ”¥!

## Quickstart Example

Use this example to start: [index.html](examples/index.html)

> Note: Your browser will try to render the index.html, so just download and start to edit it.

After downloading the example, try to add a JavaScript file as resource.
Lastly just double-click the index.html file to see it in the browser.
