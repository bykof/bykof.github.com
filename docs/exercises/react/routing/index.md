# Routing

Create a routing with [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) like in the example below.

Use a `BrowserRouter` and `NavLink` for navigation.

Use again the following requests to display albums and photos of albums:

```
Get all albums:
GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums

Get photos of an album:
GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums/${id}/photos
```
