# Requests

Build the interface in the iframe down below.

Don't forget to create proper components!

Use this API endpoints:

```
Get all albums:
GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums

Get photos of an album:
GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums/${id}/photos
```

The idea is to get all albums and display them.
After clicking on an album the application should show all photos of this album.
